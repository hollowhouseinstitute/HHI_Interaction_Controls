# HHI Interaction Controls

This repository defines **interaction-level governance controls** for systems operating under Hollow House Institute (HHI) governance standards.

## Purpose

HHI_Interaction_Controls provides:
- Canonical interaction constraints
- Execution-time control patterns
- Governance-aligned interaction documentation

This repository does **not** implement executable agents.
It defines **controls and constraints** applied to interaction surfaces.

## Governance Context

This repository operates under:
- HHI Governance Glossary
- HHI-GOV-01 (Longitudinal Behavioral Governance)
- Hollow House Institute Master License Suite (HHI-MLS)

## Key Files

- `INTERACTION.md` — interaction control definitions
- `LOCK_MANIFEST.md` — governance lock declaration
- `CANONICAL_CHECKSUMS.txt` — integrity verification

## Authority

Human authority, approval, and accountability are declared in `AUTHORITY.md`.

## Status

Early-stage, governance-first repository.
All changes are subject to governance lock discipline.
