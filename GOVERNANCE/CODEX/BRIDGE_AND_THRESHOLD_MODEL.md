# BRIDGE AND THRESHOLD MODEL

This document formalizes bridge/river/rocks as governance metaphors.

## Bridge
Interfaces between principles (Heaven) and operations (Earth).

## River
Execution-time reality where systems meet real pressure, use, and drift.

## Rocks
Anchors and probes:
- constraints that hold a boundary
- test points that reveal hidden conditions

## Governance Meaning
Interfaces (bridge) must be tested in live flow (river) using anchoring constraints and probes (rocks).
