# CODEX TRIAD MODEL

This document defines a triadic structure used to model governance across visible artifacts and hidden/latent layers.

## Triad
- Heaven (Crown): Principles / intent layer
- Earth (Mouth): Operational execution layer
- Hell (Abdomen): Risk / shadow / failure containment layer

## Layering
Each triad layer has:
- Visible: observable artifacts and signals
- Hidden: latent mechanisms shaping behavior over time

## Use
This model is a reference structure for mapping governance artifacts and decision thresholds.
