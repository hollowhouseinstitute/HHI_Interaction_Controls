# SURFACE VS LATENT LAYERS

## Surface (Visible)
Artifacts that can be pointed to directly:
- policies
- dashboards
- reports
- logs
- registers

## Latent (Hidden)
Mechanisms that shape outcomes but may not be visible:
- decision defaults
- incentives and pressures
- heuristic pathways
- normalization effects
- degradation of escalation and stop behavior

## Governance Requirement
Visible artifacts must not be treated as sufficient evidence of latent integrity.
