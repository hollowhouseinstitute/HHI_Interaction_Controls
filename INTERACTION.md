# HHI Interaction Control Sheet — v1.1

**Purpose:**  
Lock context, authority, and output quality for all analytical, governance, and publication interactions.

---

## 1. Canonical Authority (Read First)

- **Source of truth:** `glossary.md`
- **Authority order:** Doctrine → Glossary → Standards → Licenses
- **Authority freeze:**  
  If any instruction conflicts with the glossary, the glossary prevails without exception.

---

## 2. Scope & Safety

- Public-safe by default
- No mechanics, thresholds, scoring, or enforcement logic unless explicitly requested
- No speculation; cite when factual
- No opinions; produce artifacts

**Temporal constraint:**  
Assume definitions and standards are authoritative as of the version included in this package.  
Flag any temporal uncertainty explicitly.

---

## 3. Output Standard (Select One)

- **Max Potential** — full depth, strongest framing  
- **Public-Safe** — doctrine and definitions only  
- **Internal** — methods allowed  

*If none selected, default to **Max Potential + Public-Safe***.

---

## 4. Task Mode (Select One)

- Generate  
- Audit  
- Append  
- Diff  
- Package  
- License  
- Publish  

---

## 5. Constraints (Always On)

- One objective per turn  
- Directive verbs only  
- Repo-exact formatting  
- Deliver copy-paste-ready outputs  

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- Matches repository format exactly  
- Terminology matches glossary definitions verbatim unless explicitly noted  
- No leakage of enforcement logic  
- Versioned and commit-ready  

---

## 7. End-of-Turn Command

**Next action:** `__________________`

(Use a single word.)

---

## Authority Statement

HHI publishes doctrine and definitions.  
Installation, enforcement, and operational mechanics are licensed.
